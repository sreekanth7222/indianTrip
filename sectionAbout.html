          <p class="about-description">
            Indian Trip is a simple travel website created to help people discover
            beautiful places across India — temples, waterfalls, beaches, hill
            stations, caves, and vibrant cities. It works like a small visual guide
            with clean sections and short descriptions, so anyone can quickly
            understand what a place is famous for and decide where to go next.
            <br /><br />
            The website groups destinations into easy categories such as spiritual
            temple trips, nature spots like waterfalls and forests, coastal
            getaways, and city experiences full of culture and history. Each card
            shows the place name, location, and a short highlight, making it useful
            for students, families, and tourists who want a quick overview instead
            of long articles.

            <p class="founder-text">
              Sreekanth Ambavarapu started Indian Trip as a simple project to
              combine a love for coding with a love for exploring India. The idea
              was to build a clean, beginner‑friendly travel website where users
              can quickly browse important places without getting lost in too much
              text.
            </p>
            <p class="founder-text">
              As a developer, Sreekanth focuses on using modern web technologies
              and neat UI design so that every section — from temples and
              waterfalls to cities and mountains — feels smooth, responsive, and
              easy to use on both mobile and desktop. Indian Trip will continue to
              grow with more categories, better search, and smarter suggestions for
              travelers across India.
